        <h4>What is Emotional Interlligence</h4>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0%">
          Emotional Intelligence or EQ (emotional quotient) is an understanding
          and recognition of emotions. It is the ability to understand your
          emotions and emotional state, as well as the emotional states of those
          around you. Some models describe is as having four abilities:

        <h4>The Difference Between EQ and IQ</h4>
        <p>
          IQ can be roughly summed up as your ability to reason and problem
          solve. Where as EQ can be summed up as your ability to precieve the
          emotional states of yourself and those around you. IQ might help you
          solve a problem but EQ will help you deal with emotions while you are
          solving the problem.
        </p>
        <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
        <p>
          Because you will often be working with people, being able to
          understand and empathise with others would make you an incredibly
          helpful teammate. And while IQ might help problem solve abstract
          problems, EQ will help you solve interpersonal problems. It also
          allows for emotional regulation and the ability manage strong emotions
          like stress, anger, and frustration. The ability to look inside and
          discern how you are feeling, what made you feel this way, and how you
          can change how your feeling, is an invaluable skill for anyone to
          have.
