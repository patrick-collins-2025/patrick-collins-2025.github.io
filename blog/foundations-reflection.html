        <h3>Three things I have learnt about myself</h3>
        <ul class="point-list">
          <li>
            How important it is to take note of your mental space. Noticing my
            negative emotions can allow me to step outside them a bit and allow
            them to pass. Asking myself "am I feeling frustrated or Annoyed" has
            been very helpful in avoiding being stuck in those emotions for a
            long time.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learnt that my planning skills are better than I thought they
            were. Drawing up a reasonable plan for the week ahead has been very
            useful.
          </li>
          <li>
            I actually haven't procrastinated too much during this week. And I
            think I have a better handle on my procrastinating tendencies that I
            had thought.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Empathy and Self Awareness in Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Having empathy and self awareness is hugely important in learning. By
          understanding that you will struggle, not understand everything
          immeditately, and fail a lot, it can allow you avoid negative
          mindsets. And having the self awareness that you are in a negative
          mindset and having empathy for yourself is very helpful for getting
          out of them and back into a mindset more conducive to learning. Being
          able to notice when I am feeling tired, frustrated, or distracted, has
          allowed me to step away for a bit and recenter myself and then come
          back and give the problems another shot.
        </p>
        <h3>Surprises</h3>
        <p>
          I thought human skills would be very woo-woo, spirtual but it was
          definitely more grounded than I thought it was going to be. And that I
          have already found like I've gotten a lot out of the metacognition,
          and thinking about my feelings at that moment and what has caused
          them.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          I think the most challenging aspect of the human skills, especially at
          first, was fully engaging with it. At first as I said above I was
          skeptical, and I definitely still am, although I am seeing some
          benefit in some of the exercises now.
        </p>
        <h3>Human Skills Importance</h3>
        <p>
          I think human skills are very important. Coding, like every other job,
          is done with a team of people. So being able to be a part of the team
          successfully and being able interact with others in a meaningful and
          useful manner is extremely important. As well as the interpersonal
          benefits there are also internal benefit. A more accurate idea of you
          rmindset and emotions is going to increase your emotional staying
          power then things get tough. And although learning these things does
          take time away from coding, I think any time taken away from learning
          code and instead learning these human skills, at the start of this
          journey, will pay dividends on the back end.
