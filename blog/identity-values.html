        <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
        <h2 class="title-font">
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          A situation where I made an ethical decision. I'm not sure. I have
          really struggled to think of a specific decision but I would hope most
          decisions I make are ethical. The choice to boycott certain companies
          because of their on going support for genocide. Or going to protests
          against an anti-trans activist. These decisions I think are weighed up
          pretty easily, not buying a certain product and the supermarket or
          giving up a few hours out of my weekend to show support for a
          marginalised group of people. When I reflect on the decisions I feel
          that they were the correct ones and a rather easy trade off to make.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I think the people around me have influenced my values and identity
          hugely, the things I believe about myself and the world around me are
          directly impacted by how my parents raised me and who I have chosen to
          be surrounded by. My world view and my views on others, the belief of
          equality for all and the role capitalism does or does not have to play
          in it, have all been shaped by parents both directly and indirectly.
          Being white I feel a distinct lack of culture, no doubt it is there
          and that I have been shaped by it. But like what is White New
          Zealander culture? I dunno, pies maybe? I feel like this is a
          considerable more complicated topic than I have the knowledge or
          expertise for. But definitely my friends and family and teachers and
          pies have influenced my identity and values immeasurable.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.

        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I think I am deeply curious, I love to find out more about things, I
          love to know things, I love factoids. I really enjoy falling down a
          good wikipedia rabbit hole. I think this will help me in my learning
          journey to discover new things and ways of creating new things. As
          long as I can point my desire to learn things towards web development
          I should be okay.

          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I am very prone to procrastination. I really tend to not do things
          until the last moment when I begin to feel the pressure of an
          approaching deadline. Which is something I would like to change. I
          read (a headline of a reddit post) that procrastinating is linked to
          anxiety, which makes sense for me at least. And in my strengths I
          talked about my desire to learn new things may limit my learning
          journey if I'm not able to constructively aim and and make sure I am
          not getting off topic or too into the weeds. I do think this is where
          timeboxing will help me a lot.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          When I worked in a kitchen as a dishwasher and as a chef, you have to
          work productively with people everyday. However there can be a lot of
          tension. Tension between people in the kitchen, between chefs needing
          items done to serve food, tension between chefs and dishwashers
          needing certain plates or utensils cleaned or ready for service. As
          well as tension between the kitchen at large and the other parts of
          the business, management, front of house, customers. Strategies I used
          at the time, especally in more junior roles is to just go with the
          flow. Often I would be told contridictory information from different
          chefs and I found it was by far the easiest to just do it how they
          wanted. It was incredibly effective in terms of avoiding conflict and
          getting immediate work done. However it definitely wasn't the most
          effective for getting work done in the long run as it created a lot of
          tension points between chefs and would impact the teams ability to get
          work done. Now I think I would take a much more straight forward
          approach to these things, even if they might create conflict in the
          short term because I think they would create a much better environment
          for productivity.
