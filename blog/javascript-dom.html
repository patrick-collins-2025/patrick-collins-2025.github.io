        <h4>Javascript, HTML, and CSS</h4>
        <p>
          Html and css are static or still, they are incapable of moving and
          changing in response to the user. They are the information and how it
          is displayed to the user. Javascript is how the things on your webpage
          change.<br /><br />
          If HTML is all the infomation on the page: the links, the images, the
          words. Then css is the styling: how it looks, which fonts and their
          sizes, the positions of things on the page. Then Javascript is the
          animation that pulls it all together to make a dynamic page. It can
          change things on the fly: words, images, links.
        </p>
        <h4>Control flow and Loops</h4>
        <p>
          Control flow and loops are ways of selecting which bits of code are to
          be run and which aren't, and how many times. Control flow are the
          decision making of your code: if x then do y, if A then do B unless C
          then do D. This is done with if, else if, and else statements. Loops
          are how you might run the same piece of code as many times as you
          need, without knowing how many times that might be when you right it.
          <br /><br />
          Say if you were making a recipe, before you start you would need to
          get all your ingredients, the control flow for that might look
          something like this:<br /><br />
          <strong>If</strong> i have carrots then put them on the bench.
          <strong>If</strong> i don't have carrots then add to shopping list.
          <br /><br />
          Those "if's" and "thens" are controlling the flow of what is going to
          happen.<br /><br />
          <strong>IF</strong> you have carrots THEN put them on the bench.
          <strong>IF</strong> you don't THEN add them to the shopping list.<br /><br />
          This same if x then y is used in programming in the same way,
          controlling which lines of code are run and which aren't. In the same
          example you'd have to go through every ingredient you needed for the
          recipe and check if you have it or not. Thats a loop, doing the same
          thing over again, running the same code over again until a certain
          checkmark is reached, normally with some things or variables changed.
          In this example its the ingredient that changes each iteration or
          cycle of the loop until you reach the end of the ingredients list, and
          thats the end condition of the loop.
        </p>
        <h4>The DOM</h4>
        <p>
          The DOM is a way for information to be modeled, so that it can be
          interacted with. And in this case the way the information is modeled
          is called a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)"
            >tree</a
          >. Which isn't super important for this explanation but might be
          interesting.<br /><br />DOM stands for:<br />Document - webpages are
          the documents<br />Object - a thing (element, attribute, etc) and is a
          node in the DOM tree<br />Model - representation of information.
          <br /><br />It is a way of organising the information in a web page,
          like html tags or css classes or ids, and creating object equivalents
          of all that information so that coding languages can access those
          object and change thier properties or add new ones or delete them. In
          Javascript you interact with the dom by calling
          document.theFunctionYouWant() or by calling functions on a specific
          element like someElementsID.someFunction().
        </p>
        <h4>Arrays and Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Arrays are lists of information. They are a way of storing information
          in a difinitive order, starting at zero, where each item in the array
          has its own index e.g. list1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] or even list2 =
          ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas'].<br /><br />
          Objects also are ways to store information however the information is
          unordered. There are no indexes of objects, instead information is
          stored and retrived using key value pairs. Instead of an index,
          information is stored in the object with key to be used to retrieve
          that information later. <br /><br />To access information from arrays
          you need to used square brackets after the arrays name, and inside the
          square brackets you put the index you are accessing e.g.
          yourList[index].<br /><br />To access information from objects you can
          use a fullstop after the object name, followed by the key of the key
          value pair you want to access e.g. yourObject.yourKey<br />
          Or you can use square brackets as well e.g. yourObject[yourKey]
        </p>
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>
          Functions simply allow for you to avoid writing the same piece of code
          over and over again. Often used bits of code can be put into functions
          and called with
          <em>functionNameHere(SomeVariable)</em>.<br /><br />
          You might use it for summing numbers together, printing to console, or
          any number of things that you think you will use more than once. Which
          will save you time having to write the code multiple times, will take
          up less memory, and be easier to change in the future. Because
          functions are separated from the code that calls it, it also moves
          extraneous information away from your other code, making it easy to
          read and understand what is going on.
