        <h4>Javascript, HTML, and CSS</h4>
        <p>
          Html and css are static. They are the information and how it is
          displayed to the user. They are written then they are static.
          Javascript is how the things on your webpage change. If HTML is all
          the infomation on the page, the links, the images, the words. Then css
          is the styling, how it looks, which fonts and their sizes, the
          positions of things on the page. Then Javascript is the animation that
          pulls it all together. It can change things on the fly, words, images,
          links.
        </p>
        <h4>Control flow and Loops</h4>
        <p>
          Control flow and loops are ways of selecting which bits of code are to
          be run and which aren't, and how many times. Control flow are the
          decision making of your code: if x then do y, if A then do B unless C
          then do D. This is done with if, else if, and else statements. Loops
          are how you might run the same piece of code as many times as you
          need, without knowing how many times that might be when you right it.
          Say if you were making a recipe, before you start you would need to
          get all your ingredients, the control flow for that might look
          something like this: If i have carrots then put them on the bench if i
          don't have carrots then add to shopping list. Those "if's" are
          controlling the flow of what is going to happen. IF you have carrots
          THEN put them on the bench. IF you don't Then add them to the shopping
          list. This same if x then y is used in programming in the same way,
          controlling which lines of code are run and which aren't. In the same
          example you'd have to go through every ingredient you needed for the
          recipe and check if you have it or not. Thats a loop, doing the same
          thing over again, running the same code over again until a certain
          checkmark is reached, normally with some things or variables changed,
          in this example its the ingredient that changes each iteration or
          cycle of the loop until you reach the end of the ingredients list, and
          thats the end condition of the loop.
        </p>
        <h4>The DOM</h4>
        <p>
          The DOM is a way for information to be modeled, so that it can be
          interacted with. document - webpages are documents - the root of the
          trees after viewport object - a thing (element, attribute, etc) - a
          node in the dom tree model - representation of information. It is a
          way of organising the information in a web page, like html tags or css
          classes or ids, and creating object equivalents of all that
          information so that coding languages can access those object and
          change thier properties or add new ones or delete them. In Javascript
          you interact with the dom by calling document.theFunctionYouWant or by
          calling element
        </p>
        <h4>Arrays and Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Arrays are lists of information. They have a difinitive order,
          starting at zero, where each item in the array has its own index.
          Objects also are ways to store information however the information is
          unordered. There are no indexes of objects, instead information is
          stored and retrived using key value pairs. Instead of an index
          infomation is stored in the object with key to be used to retrieve
          that information later. To access information from arrays you need to
          used square brackets after the arrays name, and inside the square
          brackets yo put the index you are accessing e.g. yourList[index]. To
          access information from objects you can use a fullstop after the
          object name, followed by the key of the key value pair you want to
          access e.g. yourObject.yourKey
        </p>
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>
          Functions simply allow for you to avoid writting the same piece of
          code over and over again. Often used bits of code can be put into
          functions and called with functionNameHere(SomeVariable). You might
          use it for summing numbers together or any number of things that you
          think you will use more than once. Which will save you time, having to
          write the code multiple times, and will take up less memory, and be
          easier to change in the future. And because functions are separate
          from the code that calls it, it also moves extraneous information away
          from your other code, making it easy to read and understand what is
          going on.
