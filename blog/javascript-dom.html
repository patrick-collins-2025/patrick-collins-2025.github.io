        <h4>Javascript, HTML, and CSS</h4>
        <p>
          Html and css are static. They are the information and how it is
          displayed to the user. They are written then they are static.
          Javascript is how the things on your webpage change. It can be thought
          of as if HTML is all the information, pictures, and words on a
          newspaper headline, and css would be how that newspaper is layed out.
          What pictures are placed where and next to which headlines and how
          large the headline is. Then javascript would allow us to create those
          newspapers in harry potter where they have moving pictures and are
          interactive.
        </p>
        <h4>Control flow and Loops</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h4>The DOM</h4>
        <p>
          The DOM is a way for information to be modeled, so that it can be
          interacted with.
        </p>
        <h4>Arrays and Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Arrays are lists of information. They have a difinitive order,
          starting at zero, where each item in the array has its own index.
          Objects also are ways to store information however the information is
          unordered. There are no indexes of objects, instead information is
          stored and retrived using key value pairs. Instead of an index
          infomation is stored in the object with key to be used to retrieve
          that information later. To access information from arrays you need to
          used square brackets after the arrays name, and inside the square
          brackets yo put the index you are accessing e.g. yourList[index]. To
          access information from objects you can use a fullstop after the
          object name, followed by the key of the key value pair you want to
          access e.g. yourObject.yourKey
        </p>
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>
          Functions simply allow for you to avoid writting the same piece of
          code over and over again. Often used bits of code can be put into
          functions and called with functionNameHere(variable). Which will save
          you time, having to write the code multiple times, and will take up
          less memory, and be easier to change in the future.
