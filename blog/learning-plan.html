        <h1>BootCamp Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2 class="title-font">Long Term Goals</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I think still I'd like a web development role. Or a job that allows me
          to get better at coding everyday. So I can work on projects that I
          really enjoy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">Strengths and weaknesses</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I still am pretty good at self directed learning. I have developed
          most of my coding skills on my own. And I have been somewhat able to
          direct that learning to the correct places. And during foundations I
          have found my procrastination not too bad to manage. Using timeboxing
          and making a plan at the start of the week has helped hugely.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">Hunam Skills and non-technical challenge</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be comfort and ability
          in pair programming. Having done just one pair programming I felt
          quite nervous and really struggled during the actual coding part to
          not e distracted by the idea that someone was just watching my every
          move. The thought of making mistakes and looking like a fool was very
          distracting while I was coding. So definitely I would like to develop
          my the skills around pair programming, accepting I'm going to make a
          lot of mistakes in front of people, and hopeful that will allow me to
          get more out of the pair programming.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">Expectations</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 50px">
          My expectations for boot camp for myself will be reaching out when I
          get stuck, either in person to an instructor or someone else in my
          cohort. I expect for the bootcamp team to be ready to support me with
          guidence when I need it. I plan on managing my time with weekly and
          daily plans, outlining what I need to have done and by when. So that I
          am not going to get too overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px">07/09/2025</h4>
        <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2 class="title-font">Long term goals</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I'd like a web development role. Or a role where I can develop my
          coding skills. I currently make video games for fun so I think my
          dream would be to become a game dev, however due to the amount of
          jobs, pay, and crunch, I am happy just doing that in my spare time.
          But I'd love a job that will help be hone my skills so I can make
          better games.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">Strengths and weaknesses</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I think I am decent at self directed learning. I really enjoy learning
          new things and am good at researching topics. However I do need to
          make sure I am researching useful information and not getting side
          tracked. A weakness of mine would be my time management skills and my
          tendency to procrastinate. I can struggle with the drive to do things
          until absolutely required. But I think with the help of some planning
          and timeboxing I shouldn't struggle as much as I have in the past.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">What skills I'd like to develop</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I haven't really coded with others or coded in a group setting before,
          so I think it would be collaboration, communication, and team work
          skill that goes along with working collaboratively with others on a
          shared project is something I'd like to develop.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">Managing workload</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          For managing workloads I think planning at the beginning of the week,
          working out what and how much work I need to do this week as well as
          when that work needs to be done. That will definitely help me a lot.
          I'm not sure exactly what that will look like during the boot camp
          because I'm not sure what the learning in boot camp will look like and
          if I'll be able to plan things out as effectively. But at the moment I
          am able to skim the timeboxes and divide up my week so I have a
          healthy about of work to do without getting stressed. As to when
          things start to get to you, I think having a schedule to fall back on
          is very important. Knowing that I can take a break and not fall
          behind. As well as using pomodoro to make sure I'm getting little
          breaks through out the day to not feel too overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">Getting help</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          The discord seems like a good place to ask questions if im stuck, and
          get a response from my cohort. As well as the faciliators seem easy to
          reach if I'm really stuck. And I think if I'm stuck or not making
          progress on something after 30 minutes, that would feel like a good
          time to reach out and see if I could be doing anything differently.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-font">Facilitators expectation</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I'm not exactly sure what I expect just yet. The learning so far seems
          very self directed. But I expect that will change as the topics become
          more complex and in bootcamp. But I guess just support and guidence
          when I need it. But I imagine I'll get a better understanding of what
          I need as time goes on.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title-font">Other commitments</h2>
        <p class="main-content-paragraph">
          I do currently pick up my niece from school on thursday and then look
          after her until 5. So thursdays 2:30 - 5:30 pm. But this can be
          flexible and I won't not need to do this during the the bootcamp. And
          I might be looking after my niece for one day a week over the two week
          school holidays between 20th september to the 5th of October. But
          again this is all very flexible.
