          is how your brain is able to grow and reorganise itself. The ability
          for the brain to rewire connections, create new connections, or
          strengthen existing connections. Once thought to only exist in
          childhood, neuroplastisity exists in everyone and is an important part
          of learning.

          information. But that would happen with or without the knowledge of
          neuroplasticity, the importance of the knowledge of neuroplasticity is
          that by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity-dependent_plasticity">
