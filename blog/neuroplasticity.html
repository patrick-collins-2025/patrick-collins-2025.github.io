        <h3>What is Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"
            >Neuroplasticity</a
          >
          is how your brain is able to grow and reorganise itself. The ability
          for the brain to rewire connections, create new connections, or
          strengthen existing connections. Once thought to only exist in
          childhood, neuroplasticity exists in everyone and is an important part
          of learning.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          A
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth_mindsets"
            >Growth Mindset</a
          >
          is the idea that your ability and skill originates from learning, and
          persevering through challenges, and that failure is an important part
          of learning new information and skills. This is opposed by the fixed
          mindset that believes that ability and skill is more or less static
          and little can be done to change that. And that failure is the
          ultimate barrier between them and success.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the benefits</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px">
          Neuroplasticity:
        </h4>
        <p>
          The ability for the brain to rewire, and strength its neural
          connections is important for learning new skills and absorbing new
          information. But that would happen with or without the knowledge of
          neuroplasticity, the importance of the knowledge of neuroplasticity is
          that you now know by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity-dependent_plasticity">
            practice and repetition</a
          >
          you are able to learn things that may have seemed beyond your ability
          before, which hopefully will give you more grit and staying power when
          learning new and difficult things.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px">
          Growth Mindset:
        </h4>
        <p>
          The benefits of a growth mindset are that you can overcome difficult
          and new challenges and fail at them while still knowing that it is
          part of your learning journey. Under a fixed mindset, believing that
          failure is the benchmark of your static ability, will stop you
          learning, even if you are learning from your failures.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How can you increase your Neuroplasticity and use your Growth Mindset
        </h3>
        <p>
          Practice, repetition, connection of new knowledge to already existing
          knowledge and skill, all these things will increase and strengthen the
          neural connections in your brain, making further learning of skills
          and information in that area easier and increasing ability. And to use
          your growth mind set you need to trust that if you stick with it, even
          if you fail, in the long run will have greater ability than if you
          gave up and didn't fail.
