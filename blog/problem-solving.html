        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <h3>Stopped by a problem</h3>
        <p>
          One problem I was stuck by was the difference in calling functions on
          different data types. Specifically I was trying to call
          myObject.values() much like you might call myArray.push(someVar). When
          I should have been using Object.values(myObject). To help solve the
          issue I read the error message which was:<br /><br />
          "TypeError: object.values is not a function".<br /><br />
          Which was even more confusing because I was sure it was a function. So
          instead I started googling, and ended up reading the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values"
            >mdn</a
          >
          page for Object.values(), and where I experimented with the Javascript
          demo on the page, and I managed to figure out the issue I was having.
          Initially I felt frustrated and confused when first starting out on
          this problem, but as I started to work things out I felt... not quite
          statisfied, but maybe relief that I had figured out this problem.
          Although I definitely felt good learning about object prototypes.
        </p>
        <h3>Solving a problem</h3>
        <p>
          A problem I enjoyed solved was the best way to assign the students
          test scores array to each of the student objects stored in the
          gradebook object. I wasn't sure immediately how to solve this issue.
          Previously I searched up good ways to loop through an array, and read
          a
          <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3010840/loop-through-an-array-in-javascript"
            >stack overflow</a
          >
          talking about use cases for loops, which was very helpful. So I went
          with the forEach loop. I wanted to use the index of the students array
          to get the key in the gradebook but had some trouble creating a
          testScores key for the student object. I was trying something like:<br /><br />
          scores.forEach( (score, index) => (gradebook.students.index.testScores
          = score))<br /><br />
          And I was getting the error message:<br /><br />
          TypeError: can't access property "index", gradebook.students is
          undefined<br /><br />
          Which was very confusing because I had thought I had just defined my
          gradebook.students a line earlier, but now its undefined. So I added a
          console.log(gradebook), to make sure they still existed, which they
          did, so I did some googling and found some
          <a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dot-notation-vs-square-brackets-javascript/"
            >things</a
          >
          about dot and bracket notation that helped figure out I needed to use
          the bracket notation to access the students correctly.

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px">My Problem solving techniques</h3>
        <h4>Decent:</h4>
        <ul class="point-list">
          <li>
            Pseudocode: I have used pseudocode before and have found it very
            useful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trying Something: I am always down to try something and see if it
            works or doesn't, or whether or not it give me a different error
            message.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reading error messages: I am pretty somewhat confident in reading
            error messages, in python. But less experienced reading them in
            JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>Googling: I am very confident in google issues I am having.</li>
          <li>
            Console.logging: Definitely a favourite of mine to problem solve.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Not Good (Yet!):</h4>
        <ul class="point-list">
          <li>Rubber ducky method: Not something I have tried yet.</li>
          <li>
            Asking your peers for help: Also not something I have tried yet, and
            I'm maybe a bit nervous to.
          </li>
          <li>Asking coaches for help: Again not something I have tried.</li>
          <li>
            Improving your process with reflection: And again not something I
            have tried.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Asking for help</h3>
        <p>
          I think I could have reached out to a peer or coach when I was stuck
          on the dot vs bracket notation for accessing object properties. I
          don't think I was intentionally reluctant to reach out. I think a lot
          of my time coding has been solitary, so I have developed a lot of
          problem solving skills outside of the ability to ask someone for help.
          However maybe next time I'm stuck for a bit I'll shoot a message over
          to the discord and see if anybody else has any ideas.
