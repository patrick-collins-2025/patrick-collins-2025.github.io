        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <h3>Stopped by a problem</h3>
        <p>
          One problem I was stuck by was the difference in calling functions on
          different data types. Specifically I was trying to call
          myObject.values() much like you might call myArray.push(someVar). When
          I should have been using Object.values(myObject). To help solve the
          issue I read the error message which was "TypeError: object.values is
          not a function". Which was even more confusing because I was sure it
          was a function. So instead I started googling, and ended up reading
          the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values"
            >mdn</a
          >
          page for Object.values(), and where I experimented with the Javascript
          demo on the page, where I managed to figure out the issue I was
          having. Initially I felt frustrated and confused when first starting
          out on this problem, but as I started to work things out I felt... not
          quite statisfied, but maybe relief that I had figured out this
          problem. Although I definitely felt good learning about object
          prototypes.
